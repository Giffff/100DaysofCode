/*Wrote this program, pretty short and basic, but it required the correct the logic to give the proper output, would definitely write bigger and complex codes in the coming days. I guess I landed upto your expectations of Day 4, or atleast somewhere near to it, alot more to go, till then keep supporting and guiding.*/
