/*Wrote this code, short, crisp and to the point, will start with arrays, functions, pointers and structures from tomorrow. If you want or think I need to improvise on something or code in a diferent way like start writing the complex one's now, then please let me, I'll definitely do that. Till then keep supporting and guiding.*/
