/* wrote a code to find out the area of the circle by taking the radius as the input from the user
Pretty basic but couldn't think of anything else to start with so wrote this one, but it's definitely useful.
And I'll definitely write some big and complex codes after this in coming days, but since it's day 1 so Day 1, I got you, and the 
rest 99 days are definitely gonna be fabulous.*/
